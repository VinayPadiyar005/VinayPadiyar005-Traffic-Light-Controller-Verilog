# VinayPadiyar005-Traffic-Light-Controller-Verilog
This project implements a Finite State Machine (FSM) in Verilog to control a standard traffic light system with three states: Red, Green, and Yellow.  The FSM transitions between states on each rising edge of the clock and responds to a reset signal. The design is tested using a Verilog testbench, and simulation results are verified using Vivado.
